      <p class="style44">Chitambo District has a very good rainfall distribution 
          throughout the rain season favouring any agriculture production. In addition, 
          the distirct soil profile supports crop agriculture especially leguminous crops 
          such as beans, soya beans and pigeon pea. Other crops that have high potential 
          and can be grown in the district include; finger millet, sweet potatoes, 
          groundnuts, sunflower, pumpkins, water melons, pineapples and vegetable crops 
          that are grown off season. The District boasts of having over 15,000 small-scale

          building their offices on the new site with local authority putting up office 
          block and Resort for visitors in the district. </span></p>

      <p class="style52">TOURISM SECTOR </p>
      <p align="right" class="style51">(David Living Memorial Site)</p>
      <p class="style44"> Chitambo is positioning itself to be the tourism heartbeat of 
          the central province, having the number of infrastructure development being 
          undertaken in the District. This will trigger tourism activities in the District 
          as infrastructure such as Roads, Lodges plays a huge role in the tourism 
          industry.</p>
      <p class="style46">David Livingstone Memorial Site </p>

      <p class="style46">Kasanka National Park</p>
      <p class="style37"> <span class="style44">Kasanka National Park has been in 
          operation with amazing wildlife and elephant not exception, itâ€™s located just 
          few kilometers from Chitambo town along Mansa-Luapula Road, Kasanka National 
          Park is a home of different wild fruits that one would enjoy as they are giving 
          their eyes a clear view of wild life.</span></p>
      <p class="style44">There is high potential for Investment in quarrying especially 
          with a steady rise in the constuction industry owing to the District being under 
          significant infastructure developments since it&#39;s creation few years ago.</p>
      <p class="style44">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style52">AGRICULTURE SECTOR </p>
      <p class="style44"> Chitambo District has a favorable climate which makes it very 
          suitable to grow different kinds of crops. Chitambo District is commonly known 
          for the produce of crops such as maize, Irish potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, 
          Cassava, Beans, Soya Beans, Ground nuts, Sunflower, Pumpkins, Water Melon and 
          many other crops. The district boasts of more than 16000 small scale farmers. </p>
      <p class="style44"> In 2020, Chitambo Town Council started growing rice, with 25ha 
          and in the 2020 -2021 season the local authority increased the capacity to 50ha 
          with an estimate of 3000 by 40kgs bags to be harvested. </p>
      <p class="style44"> The Council Secretary Mr. Edgar C Mulwanda stated that if the 
          agriculture sector could be exploited well, Chitambo could develop drastically. 
          Chitambo Rice farming was not exploited much by the local people in recent past 
          but ever since the creation of the district and the commitment of the local 
          authority to commercialize the crop, the number of locals taking keen interest 
          in the commodity is growing, with the availability of Land and favorable climate 
          Chitambo district will be the hub of Rice production in the country. </p>
      <p class="style45"><img src="images/photograph_img4.jpg" width="300" height="207" 
              class="style58" /></p>
      <p class="style44">With the high number of small scale farmers and wide variety of 
          crops produced in the district, opportunities exists for investment in the agro 
          processing, and packaging of the crops produced as evidenced in the conduction 
          of the cassava milling plant which is set to be commissioned in June. </p>

      <p class="style59"> <span class="style44">Chitambo district is rich in River banks 
          with plenty of water all year round, with the good rainfall distribution that 
          the district receives the rivers are overwhelmed with good water beyond the 
          rainy season. </span></p>
      <p class="style44"> There has been some worries from the ministry of fisheries and 
          livestock about the fishing methods used by the local people in which mosquitoe 
          nets are used which is posing a threat to degrading fish in these river banks. 
          The ministry is doing everything possible to educate and imposing fish bans 
          during the fish breeding season. </p>
      <p class="style45">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style52">MINING SECTOR </p>

      <li class="style44">Iron ore</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="style44">There is high potential for Investment in quarrying especially 
          with a steady rise in the constuction industry owing to the District being under 
          significant infastructure developments since it&#39;s creation few years ago.</p>
