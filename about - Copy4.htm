            GOVERNANCE ISSUES<br>
              </span>Chitambo Town Council was established as a settlement in 2013. The administration of Chitambo TownCouncil is divided into two the first is a political wing headed by the Council Chairperson while the administration part is led by the Council Secretary and four directors representing four departments namely: Department of Human Resource and Administration, Department of Finance, Department of Works and Department of Town Planning. As a Local Authority, Chitambo Town Council operates a representative type of Local Government, with elected local leaders (the Councillors) constituting the Council as community representatives.<br>
              The Council has nine(09) wards which are smaller geographical demarcations in the seven (7) larger constituencies that constitute the broader boundary jurisdiction of the greater Lusaka City. From each constituency, one political leader is elected by popular vote as a Member of Parliament representing the community in the National Assembly. Two (2) chiefs representatives also sit on the Council.<br>
              The character of the representative system of government derive from the understanding that local communities within the jurisdiction of the Council must themselves, through their representative on the Council, participate in decision making on matters that affect their livelihood.<br>This, thus enhances the principle of self-governance through citizens participation in the decision making process.<br>However, the roles and responsibilities for Councillors and Management are distinctive. The Councillors acting as a body make policy decisions on civic matters. The Management team and its operatives ensure that the decided policies are implemented for the general good of the citizens.<br>
            Other areas of Council engagement with stakeholders (citizens) are through Management of Markets in the city. The Lusaka City Council interacts with market traders through the established Market Committees.<br>
            The Market Advisory Committee (MAC) is a committee charged with the responsibility of administering and managing the affairs of a market on behalf of the Council. Some of the responsibilities of MAC include enforcement of Council by-laws, provision of security in a market, revenue collection, monitoring standards of hygiene and general cleanliness and allocation of market stalls.<br><span style="font-weight: bolder;">DECISION MAKING PROCESS</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;

This mammoth task is performed in conjunction with other departments like City Planning and Finance Departments.<br>(i) Estate Management<br>The Council has been inviting and encouraging residents of Lusaka particularly those in peri-urban areas to come forward and renew their expired occupancy licences. Those who have no such documents are often equally advised to apply to Council for the same.<br>(ii) Trading Permits<br>Various trading licences are issued by the Council annually for those who conduct their various businesses in the city. It is illegal for one to trade or do business without a licence and such individuals are often, when found, penalised by having their businesses closed until they comply with the civic laws.<br>(iii) Lease Agreements<br>The Council also prepares and enter into lease agreements with private individuals who have entered into business partnership/relationship with the Council e.g. management of parks and open spaces, commercial properties on rental basis, etc.<br>(iv) Land Management<br>The Council also strive to reduce complaints relating to land disputes emanating from double allocations and or illegal allocation by unscrupulous people. Various measures have been introduced to try to scale down on the scourge.<br>(f) Human Resource and Administration</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; text-align: justify;">The Council’s statutory function in relation to the demography of the city’s inhabitants is to register the citizens in respect of:<br>(i) Marriages<br>The Council maintains a register of all marriages conducted in the city by marriage ministers appointed by the institution and duly gazetted.<br>(ii) Registration of Births and Deaths<br>The members of the public are encouraged to register births and deaths occurring in the jurisdiction of the city for record purpose.<br>(iii) Registration of Clubs, Societies, Associations, Traditional Healers<br>It is a statutory requirement that all such groupings conducting their activities in the city cause their existence known to the authorities (LCC) through formal registration.<br>(iv) Maintenance of Law and Order<br>It is the Council’s duty to ensure that civic laws are enforced in order to protect public property and maintain law and order in the city through the Council Police Unit. This is a cardinal service for the well being of the city.<br><span style="font-weight: bolder;">LAND ADMINISTRATION</span><br>Lusaka City Council is an agent of the Central Government in Land Administration in the City of Lusaka on behalf of the Commissioner of Lands at the Ministry of Lands. Also, Lusaka City Council is a Planning Authority in addition to the Lusaka Province Planning in addition to the Lusaka Province Planning Authority.<br>Ordinarily, Lusaka City Council would identify land and make a proposal for creation of Residential, Commercial and Institutional plots. This process may be done by the Council depending on the nature of the land, i.e. land falling under the Housing Statutory and improvement Areas and State Land.<br>Once the creation is done, the layout plan is sent to the Surveyor General’s office for numbering and later sent back to Council. The Council will advertise to the general public for them to apply for alienation of these pieces of land. Consequently, successful applicants are recommended to the Commissioner of Lands for offer letters. This procedure is also followed in areas which started as informal/squatter settlements except that the Council generates offer letters instead of recommending to the Commissioner.<br>CHALLENGES<br>The Lusaka City Council faces a lot of challenges in its execution of statutory functions, the most prominent ones being the following:<br>Illegal Land Allocation<br>The Council is an agent of the government authorised to handle land matters on behalf of the government; however due to te weakness of the of the individuals mostly party cadres have assumed the responsibility of giving out land in the city. These individuals have taken over the “planning” and “allocation” of Land illegally thereby distorting the development pattern of the entire City of Lusaka.<br>There appears to be a lacuna in the law where individuals who are not agents of the state are allocating land in the City indiscriminately. This distorts future plans and encourages more establishments of squatter settlements. This is a major challenge as the Council grapples with cases of illegal land invasions perpetuated by political hooligans especially in peri-urban areas. This has been the case in Kamwala South, Kanyama, Ngombe and Chinika, among other areas.<br>Lack of Land Spaces<br>Lusaka City Council has run out of land since the boundary of Lusaka District is too small. This has resulted into difficulties for the City to expand and meet modern City status like its neighbouring cities. For a long while now, it has even been very difficult for the Council to find free open land for use as burial site (cemetery) to replace the filled Leopards Hill, Chingwere and Chunga Cemeteries.<br>Politicisation of Public Places<br>Markets and Bus Stations are prone to politicisation which has made it difficult for the Council to effectively manage them. Political cadres have been interfering with the running of these public places to the effect that in markets such as Chibolya and Soweto the cadres have chased Council officers (cashiers) from collecting market fees. Sorting out this problem calls for political will of the powers that be.<br>Lack of Transport and Equipment<br>Despite the seemingly large fleet of motor vehicles available, as indicated in this report, the Council still needs more vehicles to be able to cope with the expanded work requirements. The Council needs more vehicles in all the inspectorate sections, road maintenance, revenue collection and other support units including procurement and police sections.<br>Some of the equipment lacking are graders, excavators, tipper trucks, rollers, water bowsers, front end loaders for road and drainage maintenance, inadequate equipment such as tower wagons for maintenance of street lighting and traffic signals, inadequate reliable equipment for effective fire fighting in the city, and generally lack of technological hardware and software facilities for effective planning, implementation, monitoring and management of projects.<br>Cash flow Problems<br>This has led to Council’s failure to meet all the demands for service delivery and effective and efficient operations.<br>Consequently, the Council has been struggling to raise resources for expansion and effective maintenance of the street lighting and traffic signals, including replacement of vandalized road infrastructure.<br>Only twenty five (25) junctions in the City have traffic signals out of fifty (50) that need the facility. An average of three (3) poles are damaged every other week.<br>As a result of the cash flow problem, the Council cannot embark on expansion programmes aimed at decentralizing public service facilities in the City, and to invest in economic ventures.<br>Non Compliance by Clubs and Societies to obtain Annual Operational Permits<br>For a long time now, the Council has endeavored to cause all social clubs, societies, associations and traditional healers conducting business in the City, to register with the local authority.<br>However, the response from the many advertisements posted by the Council inviting these entities to adhere to the said requirement by law has drawn blanks, or otherwise lukewarm.<br>The above is another example of lawlessness where individuals forming these groupings feel that they need not register their existence with the Local Authority.<br>FUTURE PLANS<br>The Lusaka City Council is desirous in providing quality public services to the community of Lusaka with the right frame of mind. In terms of planning and implementation of prudent decisions, the Council hoped to turn the many challenges addressed above into positive achievements. This is however, only possible if the Council built capacity in the Management system to enhance operations.<br>It is thus hoped that the Council will be able to implement the following plans, among many others:<br>(i) Build Ring Road System<br>This is planned in order to cab vehicular traffic congestion in the city and filter unnecessary traffic away from the city centre.<br>(ii) Decentralize Fire Stations<br>This city is fast expanding and cannot be covered effectively from the existing two (2) fire stations and so Council has plans to open up five (5) more sub-stations in areas of city not covered. The Council further hopes to acquire modern fire-fighting equipment possibly through Government intervention as the machinery are very expensive for the Council to procure on its own.<br>(iii) Comprehensive Urban Plan for the Greater Lusaka<br>The Council will continue being involved in the study on comprehensive Urban Development Plan for the City of Lusaka. The study is funded by the Japanese Government through JICA.<br>(iv) Renovation of Council Infrastructure<br>Community Halls, peri-urban suburb offices, Nakatindi Hall, Libraries, Homecraft training, and trade training facilities for the women and youth are all planned for renovation. This will go with the refurbishment of the same to make them habitable by Council staff, or use by Council clients, to enhance revenue.<br>(v) Procurement of Tools and Equipment<br>Tools and equipment in various use needs, e.g. library materials, building construction, road and drainage maintenance, office equipment etc are to be procured.<br>(vi) Integrated Management and Accounting Systems<br>The Lusaka City Council intends to ensure that it achieved both Management and Accounting integrated system of operation in order to enhance performance. This will include computerization of key operations, e.g. Human Resource packages, revenue centres etc to improve information processing and create linkages with all the departments via web, internet etc.<br>(vii) Resource Investment<br>Given increased income, the Council plans to invest excess revenue into income generating ventures in order to expand its revenue sources.<br>(viii) Improve Conditions of Service for Workers<br>Particularly, the Council will strive to improve remuneration packages for skilled professional staff in order to curb the current high rate of resignations of such qualified personnel. Training and retraining of staff in needy areas will be part of the corporate goal.<br>(ix) Increase of Transport Fleet<br>This is to improve the mobility of staff especially in inspectorate sections across Council.<br>(x) Improve Waste Management Unit Operations<br>This will include decentralizing public health services into six (6) zones, commercializing the pest control and cleansing service and opening of sinking fund for replacement of waste management equipment.<br>(xi) Funeral Services<br>The Council will diversify its service delivery by providing hearse services, and coffin-making at competitive rates.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; text-align: justify;"></p><table id="table1" style="border-spacing: 0px; max-width: 100%; color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p style="padding-left: 20px;">The current Mayor is Councillor Mulenga Sata and deputised by Councillor Potipher P Tembo .<br>Current Acting Town Clerk is Mr&nbsp;Moses Mwelwa, July 2005 todate.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.8;"></p><p>Lusaka City Council has had many mayors and town clerks.
