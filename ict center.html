      </p>
      <p align="center" class="style30">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" class="style30">His Excellency, President Edger Lungu has paid tribute to Scottish Missionery David Livingstone for exposing the horrors of slave trade and wishing the country to be a Christian Nation.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style30">&quot;Let me draw you to David Livingstone's prayer before his last breath and i quote 'On this land, on which my bended knees rest, may it become a mighty Christian Nation, a beacon of the continent of hope of Africa and a  light of the world, phophetic words which have been fulfilled,&quot; President Lungu said.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style30">The Head of State said this in Chitambo District, Central Province during the official opening of a visitor's information center at the David Livingstone Memorial Site on friday.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style30">He said the Visitor's Information Center should not only be used to learn about Dr. Livingstone but Zambia heritage from the time he was recieved on the borders and beyond.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style30">Presdent Lungu paid tribute to the people of Chitambo as Dr. Livingstone died on 1st May, 1873, in Chief Chitambo's village at Ilala near the edge of the Bangweulu Swamps in Zambia having succumbed to malaria.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style30">The Head of State recalled that Dr. Livingstone's story only talked about Chuma and Suza leaving out the role played by the people of Chitambo as the Chief and his people did their part to allow them to bury the heart in Chitambo District about 150 years ago.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style30">He said Zambia's fledging democracy today has been a beacon of light to the rest of Africa and the world.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style30">The Head of State praised the Ministry of Tourism and Arts for puttiing up infrastructure at the heritage site in line with the strategic direction outlined in the Zambia Tourism Masterplan adding that the move would attract morre tourists because of support facilities.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style30">President Lungu said the information center that he has opened was part of the tourism circult encompassing other tourist attractions such as the Kundalila Waterfalls, Mukuku Bridge, Nsalu Caves and Kasanka National Park which remained a host to the largest bat migration in the world.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style30">&quot;There is now urgent need for the Ministry to start the process of having the Kasanka National Park recognized as a World Heritage Site,&quot; He said.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style30">At the same event, the Central Province Minister Mr Sydney Mushangathanked the Republican President for the visible works he had done in the District. </p>
